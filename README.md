I am Manish Gupta, an experienced engineer with a passion for building innovative AI solutions.
<br><br>
Here's a quick overview of my journey:  

- Worked with a team at **Google X (now Google Labs)<img src=>**, tackling automation problems with LLMs to help developers write, debug, and manage large codebases.  
- Specialized in training and developing LLMs **before the Gen-AI boom**, including projects on translation using transformer models.  
- Currently at **Immersfy** as a Founding Engineer, managing all things tech—LLMs, diffusion models, deployment at scale, and ensuring secure, efficient applications.  

I also love blending hands-on tech work with a broader product vision, bringing ideas to life while leading and mentoring teams. Let's build something amazing! 🚀
